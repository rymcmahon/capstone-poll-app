# About *Power Pol*
*Power Pol* is a Rails app that ranks U.S. Senators on their independence and productivity.
Data is pulled from the *[New York Times]*(http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/congress_api) Congress API and run through a proprietary algorithm to generate each Senator’s Pol Sore.
AngularJS is used onthe client-side to allow users to search for a Senator’s individual page and it enables sorting of the ranking table by each column.
[LazyHighCharts](https://github.com/michelson/lazy_high_charts) is used to display graphical representations of each Senator’s top contributor’s and the data or these charts is pulled from the [OpenSecrets API](https://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/apis.php) API.
